## Environment Variables

Make sure to set these environment variables in your Render dashboard:

| Variable | Description | Required |

## Getting API Keys

### Reddit API
1. Go to https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
2. Create a new app (select "script")
3. Note down the client ID and secret

### OpenAI API
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Create an API key
3. Get your organization ID from account settings

### Anthropic API (Optional)
1. Go to https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Create an API key

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build fails**: Check that all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
2. **App doesn't start**: Verify the start command is correct
3. **Environment variables not working**: Make sure they're set in Render dashboard
4. **Port issues**: The app uses port 8501 by default, Render will map it to their port

### Logs
- Check the logs in the Render dashboard for any errors
- The app creates logs in the `logs/` directory

## Cost Considerations

- Render free tier: 750 hours/month
- API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic will incur costs
- Consider usage limits and monitoring

## Security Notes

- Never commit API keys to your repository
- Use environment variables for all sensitive data
- Consider using Render's secret management features
